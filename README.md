Hi, I’m Oliver 👋

Data Analyst in Training | Python Explorer | Spreadsheet Escapee

I’m currently levelling up my data skills with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and visualisation tools — building small, practical projects that turn real-world chaos into something structured, clear, and actually useful.

My background is a mix of analytical thinking, problem-solving, and hands-on operational experience. These days, I’m focused on sharpening my technical toolkit and producing work that’s clean, reproducible, and hopefully not held together with hope and caffeine.

🔧 What I’m Working On

Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas

Practical analysis tools in Python

Clear, readable visualisations (the boss-friendly kind)

Developing stronger statistical thinking

Building my own projects to strengthen my workflow and intuition

📚 Current Learning

Pandas & NumPy (and how not to accidentally nuke a dataframe)

Visualisation with Matplotlib / Plotly

Project structuring & documentation

Real-world data pipelines

Better habits in Git (read: fewer panic commits)

🧪 Things I Enjoy Building

Tools that save time

Dashboards that tell an actual story

Scripts that take messy stuff and make it behave

Mini-projects that show real, measurable improvement

📂 Featured Projects (Soon)

(I’ll add these as they get polished enough that I’m not ashamed of them.)

Data cleaning exercises

Visualisation notebooks

Small automated workflows

Exploratory analysis projects

📫 How to Reach Me

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk data, Python, or interesting datasets.
(If it’s about dashboards with 90 colours, I reserve the right to sigh loudly first.)
